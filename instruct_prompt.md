program:
- Read and analyze the raw audio file (left.raw) and the encrypted audio file (right.raw).
- Compute the frequency histograms for both files.
- Plot the histograms.
- Compare the histograms to identify any patterns or differences.
- Analyze possible transformation patterns between the raw and encrypted data.
- Identify any byte-to-byte mappings.
- Check if the transformation could be a simple XOR with a key.
- Test if the transformation follows the pattern: enc = (raw + key) % 256 or enc = (raw - key) % 256.
- Test different decryption methods and evaluate results.
- Apply the identified transformations to the encrypted data.
- Compute histograms for the decrypted data.
- Compare the histograms of the decrypted data with the raw data.
- Determine the most effective decryption method.
- Apply the best decryption method to all encrypted audio files in the modified_raw directory.
- Save the decrypted files.
- Validate the decrypted audio by comparing frequency distributions.
- Generate a report summarizing the findings and recommendations.

State each step of the program and show your work for performing that step.

Step 1: Read and analyze the raw audio file (left.raw) and the encrypted audio file (right.raw).
- Action: Use the read_raw_audio function to read the raw and encrypted audio files.
- Action: Use the compute_histogram function to compute the frequency histograms for both files.
- Action: Use the plot_histogram function to plot the histograms.
- Action: Compare the histograms to identify any patterns or differences.

Step 2: Analyze possible transformation patterns between the raw and encrypted data.
- Action: Use the analyze_transformation_patterns function to identify any byte-to-byte mappings.
- Action: Use the analyze_xor_key function to check if the transformation could be a simple XOR with a key.
- Action: Use the analyze_modular_arithmetic function to test if the transformation follows the pattern: enc = (raw + key) % 256 or enc = (raw - key) % 256.

Step 3: Test different decryption methods and evaluate results.
- Action: Use the test_decryption_methods function to test different decryption methods.
- Action: Compute histograms for the decrypted data.
- Action: Compare the histograms of the decrypted data with the raw data.
- Action: Determine the most effective decryption method.

Step 4: Apply the best decryption method to all encrypted audio files in the modified_raw directory.
- Action: Apply the best decryption method to all encrypted audio files in the modified_raw directory.
- Action: Save the decrypted files.
- Action: Validate the decrypted audio by comparing frequency distributions.

Step 5: Generate a report summarizing the findings and recommendations.
